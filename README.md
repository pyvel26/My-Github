I love learning new things!

#### What is Bak_2IT?

Well, I started in the computer industry on the deployment team in 2001 and moved on to Comcast helpdesk.  I was on the typical path to enter the IT world; however, the job market drastically changed in 2008. Also, I was young and began to explore Psychology and various jobs. I guess I needed to find myself. 18 years later, I decided I didn't want any regrets in life. I told myself that life was too short and at 43 I decided to get my MTA Database Fundamentals Certification in January of 2021. Next, I earned my MS Azure Fundamentals certification then started to learn Python.  I was determined to get Bak_2IT. :)
