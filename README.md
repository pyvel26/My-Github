I love learning new things!

What I love about Data Engineering!

Building and designing a data infrastructure are processes that involves careful planning, meetings, workshops and discussions.
It's an involved but exciting process to see each piece of the puzzle come together.  Even if something doesn't work, there are always other options. 
I realize that today many organizations use a combination of Kimbal and Inmon models when designing there data warehouse.  The great thing is that it
depends on the organizational needs. 
  
I'm fascinated with working with large amounts of data.  So far 7 million rows have been the largest dataset I've worked with.
I'm fascinated with using a variety of tools(SQL,Python, Bash) to solve problems and automate tasks.
My skills are growing stronger and I try to learn new things from more experienced professionals; therefore,
constructive criticism is welcomed.
