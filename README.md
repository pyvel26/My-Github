I love learning new things!

What I love about Data Engineering!


Data Engineering is much more than code and queries. It's building, maintaining and supporting all data systems used for analytics. These data systems are designed to support the organizations goals and objectives.  My customers are the stakeholders as well as the business users. The product I sell is accessible data thats easy to understand, query and consume. Although I have a solid idea of the typical data engineer role, I'm aware there are different responsibilities with each company.  This role requires hardwork, planning, creativity, grit and a problem solving aptitude. I have all the qualities listed and I'm looking to land my first Data Engineer role with a company that seeking someone who is industrious, self-motivated, and a quick learner.
